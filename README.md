# Mushroom-Classification-Project
A Machine Learning project trained by the "Mushroom Classification" dataset from Kaggle.

This dataset consists of 8124 rows x 23 columns and includes information about whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.
Result of the dataset is "edible: e" or "poisonous: p".

There are 6 different Machine Learning models are trained in this project, and their performance metrics are compared.

The models that are used in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Network
- Random Forest

After training these models, it is observed that both the Decision Tree and the Random Forest models have the highest accuracy rate by 0.91.
